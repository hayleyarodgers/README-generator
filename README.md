# README-generator

## Description

My goal for this project was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file, based on a user's inputs. By allowing the user to quickly and easily generate a README.md file, this application gives the user more time to devote to other parts of their project.

To achieve this, I used Javascript. In particular, I used the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) package.

During this project, I consolidated my understanding of Javascript. In particular, I re-inforced what I have learnt about:
- Node.js
- npm
- And, Inquirer.
